Hello all!

# To start up the frontend
1) `cd` into the `corona-vision` folder
2) run the command `yarn` to install all the required dependencies
3) run the command `yarn start` to start up the server

# To start up the backend
1) make sure you have `python 3.7` with `venv` installed
2) cd into the `api` folder
3) run `python3 -m venv env` to create a virtual environment
4) run `source env/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
5) run `pip install flask python-dotenv` to make sure you have the right libraries installed
6) run `flask run` to get the server started

If this isn't working consider running `export FLASK_APP=api.py` between step 5) and 6).
